They could very well improve.\\n\\nI'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months  so when I saw it open I had to take a look.\\n\\nMy first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar  but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar  saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers  and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws  napkins  and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place  not big enough for a huge crowd  but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.\\n\\nI sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu  both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good  mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita  on the other hand  was pretty awful. It had the right color  but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there  which is never a good sign.\\n\\nI ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up  I don't know. In any case  it was edible but not at all remarkable. \\n\\nWhen the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish  overcharging me  but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.\\n\\nMill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places  all with their own charms  and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year.

DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0.59-mg or 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up, 71.0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55.1%, 24.7%, and 6.2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively. Topical IOP-lowering medication was administered in 74.8% of implanted eyes, and IOP-lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies (76.2%), were performed on 36.6% of implanted eyes. Intraocular pressure-lowering surgeries were considered a success (postoperative IOP of 6-21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication) in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year. The rate of hypotony (IOP </= 5 mm Hg) following IOP-lowering surgery (42.5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery (35.4%) (P = .09).

      "data": "Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography. It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis. The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 SPECT. Does dipyridamole cause hyperemia?",

      "data": "Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies. Does haloperidol cause catalepsy?",

A retrospective analysis of 853 patients with cancer of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx operated on over a 30-year period was performed. Four hundred fifty-seven of them had a radical neck dissection (RND) at some point. Five hundred ninety patients had no clinically positive nodes (N-o) necks at the time of primary treatment; 99 of these had elective neck dissection, whereas 95 others had a delayed RND when nodes became clinically involved. Twenty-three percent of all N-o patients had microscopically involved nodes and less than half of these were among those patients selected for elective RND. Furthermore, 58% of those patients who had elective RND did not have positive nodes. Comparative analysis of elective RND, delayed therapeutic RND after clinical appearance of nodes, and composite operations for patients with N1-N3 disease indicates little difference in disease-free survival when the nodes in the elective RND were positive microscopically for tumors (56%, 49% and 47% respectively).

      "data": "Unsupervised Learning of Local Discriminative Representation for Medical Images\\nlocal discriminative representation is needed in many medical image analysis\\ntasks such as identifying sub-types of lesion or segmenting detailed components\\nof anatomical structures. however, the commonly applied supervised\\nrepresentation learning methods require a large amount of annotated data, and\\nunsupervised discriminative representation learning distinguishes different\\nimages by learning a global feature, both of which are not suitable for\\nlocalized medical image analysis tasks. in order to avoid the limitations of\\nthese two methods, we introduce local discrimination into unsupervised\\nrepresentation learning in this work. the model contains two branches: one is\\nan embedding branch which learns an embedding function to disperse dissimilar\\npixels over a low-dimensional hypersphere; and the other is a clustering branch\\nwhich learns a clustering function to classify similar pixels into the same\\ncluster. these two branches are trained simultaneously in a mutually beneficial\\npattern, and the learnt local discriminative representations are able to well\\nmeasure the similarity of local image regions. these representations can be\\ntransferred to enhance various downstream tasks. meanwhile, they can also be\\napplied to cluster anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images under\\nthe guidance of topological priors from simulation or other structures with\\nsimilar topological characteristics. the effectiveness and usefulness of the\\nproposed method are demonstrated by enhancing various downstream tasks and\\nclustering anatomical structures in retinal images and chest x-ray images.",

      "data": "Learning to Embed Categorical Features without Embedding Tables for Recommendation\\nembedding learning of categorical features (e.g. user/item ids) is at the\\ncore of various recommendation models including matrix factorization and neural\\ncollaborative filtering. the standard approach creates an embedding table where\\neach row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every unique feature\\nvalue. however, this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality\\nfeatures and unseen feature values (e.g. new video id) that are prevalent in\\nreal-world recommendation systems. in this paper, we propose an alternative\\nembedding framework deep hash embedding (dhe), replacing embedding tables by a\\ndeep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. dhe first encodes the\\nfeature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and\\ntransformations, and then applies a dnn to convert the identifier vector to an\\nembedding. the encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of\\nstorage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to\\nlearn embedding generation. empirical results show that dhe achieves comparable\\nauc against the standard one-hot full embedding, with smaller model sizes. our\\nwork sheds light on the design of dnn-based alternative embedding schemes for\\ncategorical features without using embedding table lookup.",
