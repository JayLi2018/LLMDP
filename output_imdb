 User: i m a big fan of westerns but this one whew what a stinker i think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog i think i could have written better dialog than this when i was in eighth grade and the poor actors given this terrible dialog none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous really i m not kidding some of this is little better than what you d get in an ed wood film the biggest tragedy is sterling hayden he was probably the big star in this movie which if you called it a b western you d be lavishing praise upon it this is what should be called a b minus western perhaps pity sterling hayden who appeared at other times along with joan crawford bette davis frank sinatra and other major talents for him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life one annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven t shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy i know in the old west guys weren t always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go ewwww really this is a crummy western denver pyle also had to live this one down especially after appearances in so many great westerns bad bad movie

User:ok let me again admit that i haven t seen any other merchant ivory the distributor films nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated with that admittance let me begin before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn t know which genre it wants to be at first it pretends to be a romance in most romances the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character is separated from the supporting character and is sometimes united with his or her partner this movie s hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her his name is henry moores and her name is sajani and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj british imperial rule henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid despite his legal marriage and child overseas what could be better than that they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them word spreads to sajani s husband who questions her involvement with moores she denies any contact with him but moores asks her to leave the area sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions sajani s body is discovered right as moores family comes to visit the alleged perpetrator is moores s english educated assistant t k t k knows of his master s affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened once he is declared innocent he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores t k is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall i want to warn you this isn t a romance film the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting this image is captured directly from the film s opening but quickly disappears then it s over it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love it isn t effective at all not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality they are bundles of walking clich s moores is an arrogant white man who doesn t recognize his indian friend t k s intelligence t k is torn between his own heritage and his educative background sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life oh and of course moores family is inquisitive into sajani s death but still slightly racist to indians if the tone wasn t so serious i would be willing to overlook these problems but it isn t the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development no this film isn t terrible other than the laughable screenplay it isn t poor the actors are all experienced and perform well here nandita das who plays sajani was part of wonderful indian drama water even director sivan has an impressive resume he recently oversaw the terrorist which is part of roger ebert s great movies collection what happened here why is this movie so bad well sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs apparently the story was timeless and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in s india i don t have any problem with that approach but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time the actors cinematography and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan s aura you ll probably not enjoy it my recommendation is that you presume you aren t in accordance with him and watch something else final consensus and out of

User:although released among a flock of revenge minded action flicks kill bill vol the punisher walking tall man on fire works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always watchable denzel washington one of the best actors around today in man on fire based on a j quinnell s novel first filmed in with scott glenn washington plays a down on his luck ex mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of jack daniels until his old partner christopher walken offers him a chance at redemption he is hired on as a bodyguard to the year old daughter dakota fanning of a mexican businessman marc antony and his american born wife radha mitchell while he and fanning work like oil and water first not mixing very well he really gets to form a bond with her encouraging her to do better at swimming while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past it is that very bond that will force washington back into his old line of work when fanning is kidnapped and held for a million ransom and he is nearly killed with almost any other stock action hero schwarzenneger segal etc the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we ve seen a million times before but washington s character though he s killing for a reason does not particularly enjoy doing what he does still he gets help from a very intrepid mexican newspaper reporter rachel ticotin out to expose la hermanidad the brotherhood the kidnap gang responsible for fanning s abduction man on fire is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work nearly headache inducing montage editing and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director tony scott top gun crimson tide but which are not necessarily unique to him witness oliver stone s use of montage in jfk or sam peckinpah s in his classic s and s films still scott gets a very good performance from washington as well as fanning who comes across as far more than a typical movie brat kid harry gregson williams south of the border spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of chopin debussy and even linda ronstadt s classic country rock version of blue bayou although the film overall is quite violent it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years and overall it is much better than most

 User: this is absolutely one of the best movies i ve ever seen it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriella s s ng i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy

Query [8959]:  User: bend it like beckham is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football soccer here which some may have trouble relating too in the u s it s unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here i think the basis of the storyline following a dream is something many people can relate to and in the end bend it like beckham proves to be a good feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner i highly recommend this movie

Query [5586]:  User: this movie doesn t have an awful lot to do with it s predecessor robot jox this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot jox robot wars robot jox was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn t very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch just like robot jox this is a b movie but with as a big difference that it s just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot jox got made during the s when b movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in this really can t be said about this movie it s just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking this is it that s all what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot line really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main characters seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he s god s gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone weren t they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle droids in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable you can better watch a mighty morphin power rangers episode for some more action and likability

Query [18010]:  User: this movie starts out promisingly with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary cooper s marriage to his daughter anita louise frank morgan playing an unabashed gold digger loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family including his daughter anita louise i am a fan of all actors frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure cooper a legend and louise a very lovely versatile and under appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role i also have nothing against teresa wright and while not blessed with great range she usually delivers heart warming performances from a promising opening the story slides downhill all the way to the end i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper s would be in laws the butler in such a fastidious non smoking household would never just blithely walk away allowing cooper to continue smoking or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill timed cigarette moreover nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it and finally nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche it is a poor contrivance ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny it s absurd stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense and that too is nothing to laugh about finally the scenes of cooper s overly fastidious neurotic attention to his baby s feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies but to me they just seem tedious and slow the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes while paradoxically the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not in the script to generate humor they just miss on all cylinders the laughs come not a mile a minute but more like a light year a minute the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper s love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine but none of it was extracted in the end one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt predictably it is the anita louise character who gets jilted on her would be wedding night while it is not on camera that is her fate and it is not particularly funny even as a loose end she hadn t done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike gail patrick say in my favorite wife consequently i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending too the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie s end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright i kept waiting for something to happen for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era and it never delivered a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here

Query [18969]:  User: the brain that wouldn t die was considered so distasteful in that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in the thing is both lurid and lewd but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way the story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few telephone cords a couple of clamps and what looks very like a shallow baking pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body as it happens the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks haunting strip joints visiting body beautiful contests and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow but back at the lab the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor s experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he hankers for could be leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he s been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia leith the unhappy head screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you ll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that wouldn t die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release and while the film and sound quality aren t particularly great it s just as well to recall that they probably weren t all that good to begin with now this is one of those movies that you ll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i ll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone gft amazon reviewer

 User: the brain that wouldn t die was considered so distasteful in that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in the thing is both lurid and lewd but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way the story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few telephone cords a couple of clamps and what looks very like a shallow baking pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems mightily ticked off about the whole thing particularly when it transpires that the doctor plans to attach her head to another body as it happens the doctor is picky about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to cruising disconcerted women on city sidewalks haunting strip joints visiting body beautiful contests and hunting down cheesecake models in search of endowments that will raise his eyebrow but back at the lab the head has developed a chemically induced psychic link with another one of the doctor s experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he hankers for could be leading man jason evers plays the roguish doctor as if he s been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia leith the unhappy head screeches and cackles in spite of the fact that she has no lungs and maybe not even any vocal chords busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you ll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that wouldn t die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and impressionable and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the alpha release and while the film and sound quality aren t particularly great it s just as well to recall that they probably weren t all that good to begin with now this is one of those movies that you ll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i ll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesy bizarreness alone gft amazon reviewer

Query [10125]:  User: at last i ve finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now i ve only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible this was the lovely meena kumari s film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but i m led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india it s a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me it s the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding i ve seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra

 User: at last i ve finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah up until now i ve only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the s with quirky english subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible this was the lovely meena kumari s film from start to finish and i believe was planned by her from on finally realising it in what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah necessitating a body double in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but i m led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india it s a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too but to me it s the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding i ve seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with lata because of all this but not blind to its faults pakeezah is my favourite indian movie filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the bollywood beat and bhangra
